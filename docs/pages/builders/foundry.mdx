# Start with Foundry

Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.
It is an all-in-one solution that provides everything you need to build, test, deploy, and interact with smart contracts on the FAIR blockchain.

## Prerequisites

- Install Foundry by following the instructions in the [Foundry Book](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation).

:::note
The FAIR docs are designed for use with Linux and MacOS operating systems. If you are using a Windows machine, it is recommended to use
the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to ensure compatibility. If you have issues, please [contact the FAIR team for support](https://discord.gg/skale).

## Setup Project

::::steps

### Create Directory

The first step is to create a new directory for your project and navigate into it. You can do this using the following commands:

```shell
mkdir fair-capp && cd fair-capp
```

### Create Foundry Project

The second step is to create the foundry project 

```shell
forge init
```

### Configure Foundry for FAIR

Next, you need to configure Foundry to connect and work with the FAIR network. Update your `foundry.toml` to include the following:

```toml filename="foundry.toml"
[profile.default]
src = "src"
out = "out"
solc = '0.8.24'
evm_version = 'shanghai'
optimize = true
optimizer_runs = 2000
libs = ["lib"]
```

## Next Steps

Now that your project is set up, you can start building your confidential application (cApp) on FAIR!
