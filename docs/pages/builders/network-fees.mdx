# Network Fees

FAIR implements a custom high-performance implementation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and a fully bespoke client
designed to support confidental applications (cApps) within consensus. The network implements the following fee mechanisms:

## Gas on FAIR

FAIR implements the standard EVM gas model with a few modifications to support confidentiality and instant finality.
As encryption on FAIR is optional, the default transaction utilizes the following to determine gas fees:

:::note
The base cost of a transaction on FAIR is 21,000 units of gas, same as most EVM chains.
:::

### Type-0 (Legacy) Transactions

Total Fee = Gas Used * Gas Price

### Type-2 (EIP-1559) Transactions

Total Fee = Gas Used * (Base Fee + Priority Fee Per Gas)

Where:
- **Gas Used**: The total amount of gas consumed by the transaction.
- **Base Fee**: The minimum gas price required for a transaction to be included in a block, which adjusts dynamically based on network demand.
- **Priority Fee Per Gas**: The actual priority fee paid (min of `max_priority_fee_per_gas` and `max_fee_per_gas - base_fee`).
- **Max Fee Per Gas**: The maximum total fee per gas the sender is willing to pay.
- **Max Priority Fee Per Gas**: The maximum priority fee per gas the sender is willing to pay to incentivize validators.

## Encryption (BITE) Fee

BITE Protocol utilizes the underlying threshold decryption mechanism within consensus to offer the encrypted mempool,
conditional triggers, and fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) without the use of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). However, as this is all done
directly within the blockchain, there is additional cost to using these features.

The initial cost of a BITE transaction is an additional fee of 21,000 units of gas.
This would make the minimum cost of a BITE transaction 42,000 units of gas (21,000 base + 21,000 BITE fee).

With most transactions on public blockchains being subject to maximal extractable value (MEV) through front-running and other manipulations,
the additional cost of BITE is minimal when compared to the value of confidentiality and protection from manipulation.
