# Start with Hardhat

Hardhat is a development environment to compile, deploy, test, and debug your Solidity smart contracts.
It is an all-in-one solution that provides everything you need to build, test, deploy, and interact with smart contracts on the FAIR blockchain.

## Prerequisites

- Install Hardhat by following the instructions in the [Hardhat Documentation](https://hardhat.org/getting-started/).


:::note
The FAIR docs are designed for use with Linux and MacOS operating systems. If you are using a Windows machine, it is recommended to use
the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to ensure compatibility. If you have issues, please [contact the FAIR team for support](https://discord.gg/skale).

## Setup Project

::::steps

### Create Hardhat Project

The first step is to create the Hardhat project

```shell
npx hardhat --init
```

:::tip
- Select **Hardhat 3** Beta when prompted
- Enter **fair-capp** as the project name/path when prompted
- Select **Typescript** with **Node Test Runner and Viem** when prompted
:::

### Configure Hardhat for FAIR

Next, you need to configure Hardhat to connect and work with the FAIR network. Update your `hardhat.config.ts` to include the following:

```ts filename="hardhat.config.ts"
import type { HardhatUserConfig } from "hardhat/config";

import hardhatToolboxViemPlugin from "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox-viem";
import { configVariable } from "hardhat/config";

const config: HardhatUserConfig = {
  plugins: [hardhatToolboxViemPlugin],
  solidity: {
    profiles: {
      default: {
        version: "0.8.24",
      },
      production: {
        version: "0.8.24",
        settings: {
          optimizer: {
            enabled: true,
            runs: 2000,
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
  networks: {
    "fair-testnet": {
        type: "http",
        chainType: "l1",
        url: "https://testnet-rpc.fair.cloud",
        accounts: [configVariable("PRIVATE_KEY")],
    },
    "fair-mainnet": {
      type: "http",
      chainType: "l1",
      url: "<coming-soon>",
      accounts: [configVariable("PRIVATE_KEY")],
    }
  },
};

export default config;
```

### Setup Environment

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add your private key:

```plaintext filename=".env"
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
```

## Next Steps

Now that your project is set up, you can start building your confidential application (cApp) on FAIR!
