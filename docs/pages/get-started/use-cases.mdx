# Use Cases

Confidential compute unlocks a wide range of applications that struggle to operate on traditional blockchains due to lack of privacy at the transaction level or
due to lack of confidentiality in data processing and storage. This opens the door for innovative use cases across various industries including: artificial intelligence, consumer applications, finance, healthcare, and supply chain management.

## Confidential Applications

At the most basic level, FAIR unlocks a new primitive -- **confidentiality** -- that can turn every application into a confidential application (cApp).
This sets a default expectation of privacy for users and developers, allowing them to execute onchain without the fear of manipulation (i.e front-running)
no matter the application they are using.

:::note
Any existing application built on an EVM-compatible blockchain can be turned into a cApp with *ZERO* changes to the smart contracts. Just a few lines
of code on the frontend and your favorite application can bring you the level of confidentiality you expect from the internet in <Year />.

## Confidential DeFi

FAIR enables confidential decentralized finance (DeFi) applications that protect user trades and transactions from prying eyes.
This allows users, institutions, and agents to engage in financial activities without fear of exposure or manipulation.

## Permissionless Banking

Blockchain Integrated Threshold Encryption (BITE) brings an implementation of fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) to blockchain without the use of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs).
This allows for complex computations to be performed on encrypted data without ever decrypting it, meaning that a bank can run their operations directly onchain including functionality like:

- Performing risk assessments on customer data without ever accessing the underlying sensitive information.
- Offering checking and savings accounts with encrypted balances and transaction histories.
- Enabling encrypted loans and credit services where sensitive financial data is never exposed.

:::tip
BITE can also be used to create confidential tokens that represent real-world assets, allowing for private transactions and ownership verification without revealing sensitive information.

## Agentic Finance

AI Agents are still in their early stages of adoption, yet the innovation and growth is staggering. While the applications are endless, one thing is clear: AI Agents are the preferred
way to interact with digital services and applications for many in the form of a chat interface -- including for many, financial services.

However, agents have the ability to operate in a way that humans and even pre-programmed algorithmic bots never could; through constant small interactions to achieve a specific goal.
Agents can combine data from many sources, determine the best course of action, and automatically execute. Instead of relying on expensive human advisors or mutual funds for active management, 
the future shows that people want agents to manage portfolios, create "manual ETFs", and execute complex strategies on their behalf.

FAIR enables agentic finance to work as intended by allowing AI agents to operate onchain with confidentiality, ensuring that sensitive financial data and strategies are never exposed to the public or competitors.

## Shielded Markets

Prediction markets and perpetual markets are incredibly inefficient on blockchains today. Public mempools allow for front-running and manipulation, making it difficult for these markets to function efficiently.
FAIR's encrypted mempool protects user trades and positions which should lead to more efficient markets and improved price discovery.
Adding conditional transactions (CTXs) to the mix allows for complex strategies to be implemented directly onchain without the need for extensive offchain infrastructure or oracles.

## Onchain Automation

BITE Protocol brings a new second primitive to blockchain -- **conditional triggers** -- that allow for complex conditions to be evaluated automatically onchain 
only when certain conditions are met. This enables a new class of applications that have historically not come on chain or relied on expensive and insecure oracle systems.

While great for CLOBs, prediction markets, swaps, and other financial applications, CTXs can also be used to create complex workflows that are automatically executed when certain conditions are met; bringing
automation to a wide range of industries including supply chain management and healthcare.

## Encrypted Voting Systems

FAIR can be used to create secure and transparent voting systems that protect voter privacy while ensuring the integrity of the election process.
By leveraging confidential execution, voters can cast their ballots without revealing their identities or choices, while still allowing for verifiable results.
