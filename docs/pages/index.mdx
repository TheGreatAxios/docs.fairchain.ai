FAIR is a layer 1 blockchain built for confidential compute and a seamless open economy between humans and AI.

Powered by Blockchain-Integrated Threshold Encryption (BITE link below) at the consensus layer, FAIR introduces an encrypted mempool that protects all transactions from individuals to autonomous agents by default.
FAIR is built to be the backbone of an ever-growing and evolving financial ecosystem that prioritizes confidentiality, scalability, and innovation.

Blockchains have become the foundation for a new digital economy; bridging the gap between traditional money and technology.
With billions of dollars of real world assets (RWAs) minted across hundreds of chains, over $250,000,000,000 (billion) in stablecoin supply, and trillions in monthly volume
of stablecoins alone; the need for a blockchain ecosystem that can meet the demand with end-to-end encryption is needed.

## Why FAIR?

### Confidential by Default

Privacy is an ideal, but confidentiality is essential. FAIR's encrypted mempool ensures that all transactions are confidential by default, protecting user data from exposure and misuse.
This is crucial to allow real businesses and institutions to operate onchain without the risk of sensitive information or actions being leaked.

### An Open Economy for the AI Era

The explosive growth of artifical intelligence (AI) is driving unprecedented demand for compute resources and data. This demand will continue to grow
and require tens of thousands if not millions of blockchains. Such a system can grow through a protocol like SKALE, which requires the a base layer with
both scalability and confidentiality while providing deep liquidity and interoparability for the broader ecosystem.

### EVM Compatibility

FAIR is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)*, enabling developers to leverage existing tools, smart contracts, libraries and even full applications.
This compatiblity lowers the barrier for entry and accelerates the adoption of FAIR, even with the integration of BITE Protocol.

### Instant Finality

FAIR utilizes a novel Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism with instant finality. This ensures that transaction are confirmed and irreversible as soon as they
are included in a block. This makes FAIR the only Layer 1 EVM blockchain with instant finality; a feature that the next generation of Layer 1 blockchains MUST have
to support the needs of an ever-evolving financial system.

### Native Scaling with SKALE

Blockchains are a unique distributed ledger technology system that act as a hybrid between databases, networks, and servers.
While FAIR is a highly-scalable distributed system; the world cannot just run on a single blockchain (or even a thousand blockchains).

To truly bring the world onchain, an autonomous blockchain network is needed to provide secure blockspace on demand that is fully compatible and interopable with
a deep set of liquidity. FAIR comes to life with SKALE, the leader network for on demand blockspace, ensuring that no matter how many projects come and build; there is always
room for more.
